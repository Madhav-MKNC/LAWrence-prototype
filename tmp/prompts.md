Situation:
Mr. X had been employed at Y AG for six years based on a verbally concluded employment contract. A few months ago, he got a new boss with whom he apparently did not get along. In light of the worsening relationship with his superior, Y AG saw no other option but to part ways with X. On Tuesday, February 24, 2015, they sent X a letter of termination via registered mail. Since X was not at home during the delivery attempt on Wednesday, February 25, a pickup invitation was left in his mailbox. Subsequently, X collected the mail from the post office, but only on the following Monday, March 2. In the letter of termination, Y AG stated that they wanted to dissolve the employment relationship at the earliest possible termination date.

Question:
When does the employment relationship end?
